	Setting: listening_port
	Description:
		The port for the Mongoose web server to listen on.
		This may be prepended by the specific IP address to bind to.
		If just the port is specified, the Mongoose web server will listen to all addresses.
	Default: "3302"
	Example(s):
		server_listen = "4823";
		server_listen = "192.168.0.124:2204";

/*
	Setting: ssl_certificate
	Description:
		Path to a SSL certificate file.
		The file must be in PEM format, and it must have both a private key and a certificate.
		If this option is set, then the Mongoose web server serves SSL connections on listening_port.
	Default: ""
	Example(s):
		ssl_certificate = "ssl_cert.pem";
		ssl_certificate = "C:\web\sqfrcon_ssl.pem";

/*
	Setting: authentication_list
	Description:
		A list of all of the usernames and passwords to accept when requesting RCON access.
		Multiple users may be set, so users may be revoked at any time without disrupting the
		access for others users.
	Default:
		authentication_list = (
			{
				username = "admin";
				password = "N6juwc4ZaH0TL+KQUdymKdFk4sSVi6FB1fQTOjPwaI8="; // Password: default
			}
		);
	Example(s):
		authentication_list = (
			{
				username = "user1";
				password = "xWX+A8qbYkLgHf3e/pu6PZiycOGc0C/YXOr3XislvxI=";
			},
			{
				username = "user2";
				password = "92BDp07DO2rvuyiQUPr3qo1IIJVHc5fj5jNFEl1J9Sc=";
			}
		);
	Notes:
		1. All passwords must be stored as base64-encoded SHA256 hash values.
		2. Go to http://webcodertools.com/hashstring to convert to a base64-encoded SHA256 hash.
		   Alternatively, you can start-up the server and send an invalid username/password
		   combination, and it will return the password in SHA256 format.
		3. You must append a comma (after the '}') to each user entry except the last.
		4. Do not store any of the passwords in plain-text format (for security reasons).
		   This is because if an attacker were to get access to this config file, he or she wouldn't
		   be able to use any of the listed passwords.
		5. All usernames and passwords (pre-hashed) are currently limited to 64 characters in length.
		6. You will use the standard plain-text password for access via RCON, so don't forget it!
